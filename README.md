# lmms_scrapping
Python Code in order to scrap resources published in LMMS Webpage.

LMMS is a open-source DAW ( Digital Audio Workstation ). If you want to produce your own music and edit your own tracks, not only experience and knowledge is needed if you can't access to resources like samples, presets, and projects that are not available unless you pay for it.

LMMS has a huge library with sounds published that anybody can download, but it's very complicated to reproduce it in real-time.


![LMMS Presets][LMMS_rsc_section]



![LMMS resources][LMMS_rsc]

Therefore this script has been created to download in one folder this resources and begin to produce music.

## Requirements

sudo pip install wget
sudo pip install beautifulsoup4
